This folder consists of the work with Stanford Dataset
It broadly consists of Three items:
    1) Jupyter Notebook to train all kinds of models on the network with our own dimension
        In this notebook, if we specify the Model and the dimension of each image, 
        it will train the model accordingly.
        
    2) Models Trained for Classification:
        This folder consists of already trained models and also their jupyter notebooks.
        We have trained the MobileNet, VGG16 and InceptionV3 models on the StanfordDogs
        image dataset. This also consists of the already trained models of each of the 
        above types which can be directly loaded. 
        
    3) The third part of this section consists of the GAN. In this section, we attempted
        to train the network to create photos of dogs. The jupyter notebook consists of the code, 
        and the model is already pretrained. It also has a gif which shows the evolution
        of the dogs being generated.
